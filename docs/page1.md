### The Beggining

This is going to be the first application of the Runge-Kutta Methods. Starting off, I wanted to just implement a 4th order scheme for a simple ode example. After setting up the project in a organized way, I messed around a bit an implemented an integrater. The steps I'll be taking to improve this is to add functionality to solve n systems instead of just one. By the end of the day however, I got some pretty plots:
